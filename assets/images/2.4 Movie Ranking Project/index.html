<h1>ANNABELLE'S BEST SERIES SO FAR</h1>
<h2>My top 3 to date!!!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>NIGHT AGENT</h3>
<p>It's full of suspence, some action scenes, betrayal and love. It will keep you on the edge of your seat all through</p>
<h3>THE GLORY</h3>
<p> It talks about revenge. Some scenes can be hard to watch. I loved it but had mixed feelings at the end though</p>
<h3>THICKER THAN BLOOD</h3>
<p>It's about family bonds: it depicts the sacrifices and risks one can take to save or cover up for a loved one</p>
